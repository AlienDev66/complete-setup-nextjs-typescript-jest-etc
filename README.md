## About


Next.js is a minimalistic React framework that runs on the browser and the server. It offers developers an easy way to get started, and as it uses React.js for templating, it's also a straightforward way for developers with React experience to get productive quickly.

The advantage of this approach is to be able to create rich user experiences in a uniform way, without compromising SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) factors that are key to good ranking on Google and other search engines.

This SETUP makes it easier to get up and running with a well-structured Next.js and TypeScript application.

## Setup & Documentation

IN DEVELOPMENT

<br/>

## Built-in CLI

<br/>

<br />

To start the Project, you may have to meke it beforehand if you haven't yet.

```
~ $ git clone https://github.com/AlienDev66/complete-setup-nextjs-typescript-jest-etc.git
```
Install dependences with:
```
~ $ yarn install
```
or
```
~ $ npm install
```

Then you can use this project:
```
~ $ yarn dev
```

After starting, an interactive menu will let you configure the component to be created. Firstly, you'll be asked for the type of the component whether it's a page or a functional component. Then you'll be prompted with the other options relevant to your selection.

Eventually, you'll end up with a page or component with style and test files in no time.
